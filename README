This Perl extention allows you to extract information from various
image files.  In this alpha release we only support JPEG (plain JFIF
and Exif) and PNG.  Usage is something like this:

   $img = Image::Info->new("filename");
   $hash_describing_1st_image = $img->info(0);   # or missing arg
   $hash_describing_2nd_image = $img->info(1);

TODO:
   - add support for more image formats
   - decode Exif integer codes
   - standardize hash names (based on TIFF?)
   - rational class
   - Image::TIFF should not need to slurp
