=head1 NAME

Image::Info - Extract information from image files

=head1 NOTE

This is an B<alpha release> of the C<Image::Info> module.  The
interface to the routines described below is likely to change.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Image::Info qw(image_info dim);

 my $info = image_info("image.jpg");
 my($w, $h) = dim($info);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provide functions to extract various information from
image files.  The following functions are provided:

=over

=item image_info( $file )

This function takes the name of a file or a file handle as argument
and will return one or more hashes describing the images inside the
file.  If there is only one image in the file only one hash is
returned.  In scalar context, only the hash for the first image is
returned.

In case of error, and hash containing the "Error" key will be
returned.

=item dim( $info_hash )

Takes an hash as returned from image_info() and returns the dimensions
($width, $height) of the image.  In scalar context returns the
dimensions as a string.

=item html_dim( $info_hash )

Returns the dimensions as a string suitable for embedding into HTML
tags like <img src="...">.

=back

=head1 Image descriptions

The image_info() function return information about an image as a hash.
The key values that can occur is based on the TIFF names.

The following names are common for any image format:

=over

=item file_media_type

This is the MIME type that is appropriate for the given file format.
This is a string like: "image/png" or "image/jpeg".

=item file_ext

The is the suggested file name extention for a file of the given file
format.  It is a 3 letter, lowercase string like "png", "jpg".

=item width

This is the number of pixels horizontally in the image.

=item height

This is the number of pixels vertically in the image.  (TIFF use the
name ImageLength for this field.)

=item color_type

This is a short string describing what kind of values the pixels
encode.  The value can be one of the following:

  Gray
  GrayA
  RGB
  RGBA
  CMYK
  YCbCr
  CIELab

These names can also be prefixed by "Indexed-" if the image is
composed of indexes into a palette.  Of these, only "Indexed-RGB" is
likely to occur.

It is similar to the TIFF field PhotometricInterpretation, but this
name was found to be to long, so we used the PNG term instead :-)

=item SamplesPerPixel

This says how many channels there are in the image.  For some image
formats this number might be higher than the number implied from the
C<ColorType>.

=item BitsPerSample

This says how many bits are used to encode each of samples.  The
number of numbers here should be the same as C<SamplesPerPixel>.

=item Resolution

This field is instead of XResolution/YResolution when the pixels in
the image are square.

=item ResolutionUnit

This is a string like C<dpi>, C<dpm>, C<dpcm> giving the physical size
of the image on screen or paper.  If missing when
XResolution/YResolution is present, then the resolution is used to
denote the squareness of pixels in the image.

=item XResolution

The horizontal size of pixels.

=item YResolution

The vertical  size of pixels.

=item Comment

Textual comments found in the file.

=item Interlace

If the image is interlaced, then this tell which interlace method is
used.

=item Compression

This tell which compression algorithm is used.

=back

=head1 Supported Image Formats

The following image file formats are supported:

=over

=item JPEG

For JPEG files we extract information both from C<JFIF> and C<Exif>
application chunks.

C<Exif> is the file format written by most digital cameras.  This
encode things like timestamp, camera model, focal length, exposure
time, aperture, flash usage, GPS position, etc.

=item PNG

Information from IHDR, PLTE, gAMA, pHYs, tEXt, tIME chunks are
extracted.  The sequence of chunks are also given by the C<PNG_Chunks>
key.

=item GIF

Both GIF87a and GIF89a are supported and the version number is found
as C<GIF_Version> for the first image.  GIF files can contain multiple
images, and information for all images will be returned if
image_info() is called in list context.  The Netscape-2.0 extention to
loop animation sequences is represented by the C<GIF_Loop> key for the
first image.  The value is either "forever" or a number indicating
loop count.
